WWW-Salesforce-Report

Create a rough API for Salesforce.com reports. Reports are downloaded in CSV
format from Salesforce and can then be cached locally in a SQLite database.
Regular SQL queries can then be ran on the data.

The reports can also be downloaded in Excel format, which will not be
cache in a local database but can be sent as an attachment to users for example.

Alternatively you can read an load a local file, in CSV format that can also
be imported into the local database and processed as the downloaded report data
This feature can be used to store the raw report data locally and is great for
testing. Run your script once, save the downloaded report
in CSV format and afterwards you can run the script using the local file
instead of connecting to Salesforce.com.
